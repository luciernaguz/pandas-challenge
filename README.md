This repository is for putting Pandas Librarys and some Jupyter Notebook skills to use.
For this challenge select to solve the option about games "HeroesOfPymoli".
Perform the normal operations on the dataframe to obtain the corresponding groupings to solve.
The notebook I present here is the clean version of my previous Jupyter notebook.
Basically most of the solutions were solved making use of groupby identifying the column to be filtered and generating a dataframe and depending on the cases select to format the information using map or style.
