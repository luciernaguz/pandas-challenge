_Pandas Challenge Bootcamp_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Goal: This reposity is to put in practice Pandas Librarys and also Jupyter Notebook
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository is for putting Pandas Librarys and some Jupyter Notebook skills to use.
For this challenge select to solve the option about games "HeroesOfPymoli".
Perform the normal operations on the dataframe to obtain the corresponding groupings to solve.

The notebook I present here is the clean version of my previous Jupyter notebook.

Basically consists of taking the source file with a csv extension from the Resources folder, loading this file and take a look of the information, I decide that most of the solutions were solved making use of groupby identifying the column to be filtered, put the corresponding information in variables and then placing it in the different DataFrames, then to format the information using map or style.

To see the result, the most convenient thing is to take all the contents of the folder, so that the input information is taken, let's say the solution is to open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run it, the solutions will be shown.

This challenge was complete done. Feel free to make any comments and observations. Thanks.

In the end the notebook was saved with the dataframes already resolved and displayed, it is not necessary to do the run.
