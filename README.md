_Pandas Challenge Bootcamp_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Goal: This reposity is to put in practice Pandas Librarys and also Jupyter Notebook
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository is for putting Pandas Librarys and some Jupyter Notebook skills to use.
For this challenge select to solve the option about games "HeroesOfPymoli".
Perform the normal operations on the dataframe to obtain the corresponding groupings to solve.

The notebook I present here is the clean version of my previous Jupyter notebook.

Basically most of the solutions were solved making use of groupby identifying the column to be filtered and generating a dataframe and depending on the cases select to format the information using map or style.

The solution consists of taking the source file with a csv extension from the Resources folder, loading this file and manipulating it with the grouped files, and placing it in the different DataFrames for each question they request to be solved.

To see the result, the most convenient thing is to take all the contents of the folder, so that the input information is taken, let's say the solution is to open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run it, the solutions will be shown.
